# Land-cover-classification---computer-vision
This is my first computer vision project. I used satellite images to perform simple land cover classification, separating vegetation, water, and urban areas. The project uses Python, OpenCV, and Jupyter Notebook with color thresholding and morphological operations. A starting point for exploring CV.
